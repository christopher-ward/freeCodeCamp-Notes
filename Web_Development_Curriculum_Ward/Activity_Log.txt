Beginning a log to track time that I've devoted to learning Web Development skills to become more marketable.

I should include what type of activity has occured in regards to this effort. Also include amounts of time if multiple courses/types of work were done.

Also describe main topics explored or utilized during the work time. At least 10 or 15 minutes should be devoted to this each day after study/work. 

On weekends, do the same every 2 hours or halfway through the work/study time for the day.

Sample Log:

Began Creating List of topics/courses to cover while learning/studying/practicing.
For the most part freeCodeCamp should be effective in covering many of the topics.
However, there are some topics that should be explored outside of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
There should also be components utilized in addition to each topic covered on freeCodeCamp.

At the moment, the main topics to cover are HTML/CSS, Javascript, WebDev soft skills, Training Projects, Web Development Training, and Debudding Training.

About an hour was devoted to this effort. First night of the rest of your career. 

Will devote about an hour or so more to the topic.
