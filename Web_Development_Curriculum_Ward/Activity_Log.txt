.LOG

8:17 PM 4/25/2019
Beginning a log to track time that I've devoted to learning Web Development skills to become more marketable.

I should include what type of activity has occured in regards to this effort. Also include amounts of time if multiple courses/types of work were done.

Also describe main topics explored or utilized during the work time. At least 10 or 15 minutes should be devoted to this each day after study/work. 

On weekends, do the same every 2 hours or halfway through the work/study time for the day. 


9:10 PM 4/25/2019
Sample Log:

Began Creating List of topics/courses to cover while learning/studying/practicing.
For the most part freeCodeCamp should be effective in covering many of the topics.
However, there are some topics that should be explored outside of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
There should also be components utilized in addition to each topic covered on freeCodeCamp.

At the moment, the main topics to cover are HTML/CSS, Javascript, WebDev soft skills, Training Projects, Web Development Training, and Debudding Training.

About an hour was devoted to this effort. First night of the rest of your career. 

Will devote about an hour or so more to the topic.

1:46 PM 4/27/2019
Beginning Javascript curriculum on freeCodeCamp. Will probably end early to switch to other topic or change locations.

2:56 PM 4/27/2019
I stopped about 30 minutes ago and took a quick nap


11:02 AM 4/28/2019
Started at Viento y Agua. Laptop log is not in line with desktop log.

1:25 PM 4/28/2019
Been working on applied accessibility and will now take a break and shift to a different topic when start back up.
Quick summary of what I learned off the top of my head:
Changing the contrast of the color to background-color to a ratio of at least 4.5:1 will making the text easier to see, especially for individuals with vision problem.
Also having the background and foreground colors to similar can cause problems for individuals with color-blindness.
There are also ways to give accesskeys to elements on the page so that keyboard-only users can easily jump to important elements using alt + the accesskey assigned.
There is also ways to highlight a region that is tabbed to in order to bring attention to it as an important element to pay attention to.
The focus order when pressing tab in a page can also be modified using the tabindex attribute. tabindex="0" is same as default and tabindex="1", "2", "3", etc.
will have focus priority numerically before "0". 

Elements assigned with the same tabindex values will progress in the order the elements appear in html after focus priority considered.
Ex. tabindex="1" will focus before "2" and "2" will focus before "0" and duplicate values will focus in order of progression in the html from top to bottom after tabindex value priority. 

2:20 PM 4/28/2019
Starting back up. Going to focus on Javascript now.

3:00 PM 4/28/2019
Still going, just wanted to summarize what I've learned so far before I forget.
Single quotes and doublequotes can be used interchangably around string literals. There can also be a mixture of double and single quotes within a string literal.
However, if a string literal declaration begins with a single quote, the next time a single quote appears, that will represent the ending of the assignment.
If this ends the literal to soon, use \ to escape before the quotation mark, or switch to double quotes, and vice-versa. There are also other escape features
such as \n (newline), \t (tab), \\ (backslash, or \), etc.

You can also append using +. This can be used in assingments and mixing string literals with variables or variables with variables. Aslo += can be used to append onto current variable string value.
Going back to the Javascript freeCodeCamp.

3:20 PM 4/28/2019
OK, now I'm done with Javascript. Going to head home now.

8:37 PM 4/28/2019
Starting to work again and going to look at more Responsive Web Design Principles.

9:34 PM 4/28/2019
Taking break. Touched up on responsive design principles. Media queries allow features to change with changing size of screen or browser size.
Images can be made responsive to size changes using percentages. Changing an image's width and height to half the original size to make it appear higher resolution and
also optimize for retina displays. You can also have text size change in relation to viewport dimensions (vw, vh, vmin, vmax). And began flexbox.

11:37 PM 4/28/2019
Putting in another hour. Going to read some articles, do some javascript and apply some accessibility tools to my Harvard CS50 Project.

12:35 AM 4/29/2019
Stopped around 30 minutes in.

9:17 AM 4/29/2019
Starting at Hidden House Coffee. Going to start with Responsive Web Design for a little while. Then editing the old project to bring it up to accessibility standards. Then probably Javascript. 

11:06 AM 4/29/2019
Stopped about 20 minutes ago. The flexbox topics so far have largely been refreshers of concepts previously learned but are good to review. Some of the terminology is slightly different or more in depth.
Next up I'll work on updating the old project.

12:19 PM 4/29/2019
Added figure tags and figcaption to make img elements more accessibility to screen readers on old Project0 from Harvard CS50 Web course. It was only added to page_7, next in that project will be adding
accessibile forms for practice and ensuring the rest of the elements have accessibility aspects included.
Taking a break. May go to lunch before starting again. May do some more Javascript before that.

12:36 PM 4/29/2019
Going to leave Hidden House and go get lunch.

5:11 PM 4/29/2019
Started reading articles about 45 mins ago. Starting back on Flexbox. More than halfway through and then one more section before projects.
Closer and closer to the Responsive Web Design Projects.

6:21 PM 4/29/2019
I didn't start flexbox. Instead I started to look into how to automate adding new files to be tracked, committing and pushing to github using bash script.
I was able to create a script that checks the status, adds all untracked files, commits with a string literal set in the script and pushes to github.
I want to edit the script to be able to take a commit message from the user to be used for the commit step.
The user should be prompted to give a commit message and have everything else automated. The git status should show before the prompt for the commit message.

6:31 PM 4/29/2019
Taking a break to walk the boys and stretch. So far up to 4 hours 15 min of actually work today. Goal is 6 hours. 1 hour 45 min remaining.

7:20 PM 4/29/2019
Been back from the walk for about 20 minutes and working on the script. Going to go to pool for a little bit with Evelyn in about 5 minutes.

8:38 PM 4/29/2019
Returned from pool about 30 min ago and have been researching how to have user input in bash. Going to cook dinner soon. 1 hour 15 min remaining.

9:02 PM 4/29/2019
Very close to a finished script. Getting things working. Breaking for Dinner. 45 Mins remaining

9:50 PM 4/29/2019
Starting back up.

11:10 PM 4/29/2019
Stopped to check laundry about 10 minutes ago. Realizing, I have exceeded 6 hours of study/devWork.

Today, I revisited some flexbox basics. Started adding some accessibility items to the old CS50 Project0. Read some articles.
Found some new resources. Decided to take a look into bash scripting. 
Began creating a script to make committing and pushing new changes easier/quicker.

Tomorrow, I'll go back to normal weekday hours. I'll try to finish up the flexbox section and some of the next section tomorrow morning/night. 
And then, the next morning, I will be heading to Coachella valley with Cesar to work on his project.
We will also be spending the night there, so I may be able to get some work done there. I also may not.

This weekend, including today(Sat, Sun, Mon), I worked 13 hours and 3 minutes.


7:41 PM 4/30/2019
Tuesday:
Going to work for about 25 min.

8:49 PM 4/30/2019
Stopped about 25 mins in.

7:04 PM 5/3/2019
Going to start working with an SQL Tutorial I found online.

I also read a few articles and think I want to start integrating questions and reviews to these notes to be revisited as I continue to learn and prepare for my career.

11:34 AM 5/4/2019
It didn't last long at all last night. Maybe did 45 min total last night.

Starting again. Will stop in about 30 for lunch.

2:33 PM 5/4/2019
Worked for about 30 min. Starting back up. Going to watch a video about loop vs recursion, and then will finish flexbox and move on from there.

3:39 PM 5/4/2019
Didn't end up doing much. Starting on CSS Grid now.


5:00 PM 5/4/2019
CSS Grid Summary:
Worked for about 1 hour 15 min. Learned a lot about CSS Grid.

What can CSS Grid allow you to do very quickly? What are the CSS grid units?

How are gaps within the grid created? 

How does grid-column control grid item spacing? What does this mean? grid-column: 1 / 3; (grid-row?)

How do you align an item horizontally? Vertically? (How does start end and center relate to this?)

How do you align all items at once? 

Explain the significance of grid-area-template and give an example. What does each word and pair of quotation marks mean in terms of the grid?

Individual grid items can be assigned to areas using the grid-area property and the name of the area name. This relates to grid-template-areas.

Going to take a little break, maybe go get groceries. This type up took around 15 minutes. So total today: 2 hours


10:09 PM 5/4/2019
Starting again.


11:45 PM 5/4/2019
Just finished CSS Grid section.
How is grid-area used to define the area for an item? How does repeat function reduce repetition? 
Auto-fit and auto-fill are different. What are the differences? How are Media Queries used to create responsive layouts?

I'll see how much more I can do. The Responsive Web Design Projects are up next in the Responsive Web Design Curriculum.

Total so far: 3 hours 30min

12:51 AM 5/5/2019
Didn't do much. Maybe about 30min.

Starting some more. So far: 4 hours.

1:51 AM 5/5/2019
Stopping now. I read articles about Mastery Based Learning, learning method. 
I like aspects of what it said. I feel that I've been gravitating toward that more, lately.

I will have to explore more later, but for now, I'm going to focus on those Responsive Web Design projects and to a lesser extent, Javascript.

Was able to work for 5 hours today.
